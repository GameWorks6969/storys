Patrick never did his homework. **"Too boring,"** he said.
He played hockey and basketball instead. His teachers told him,
**"Patrick! Do your homework or you won't learn a thing."** And
it's true, sometimes he did feel like a ignoramus. But what could
he do? He **hated** homework (like me xD).

      Then one day he found his cat playing with a little doll
and he grabbed it away. To his surprise it wasn't a doll at all,
but a man which was very smoll. He had a little wool shirt with
old fashioned britches and a high tall hat much like a witch's.
He yelled, **"Save me! Don't give me back to that cat. I'll grant
you a wish, I promise you that!"**
\
\
      Patrick couldn't believe how lucky he was! Here was the
answer to all of his problems. So he said, **"Only if you do all
my homework till the end of the semester, so in 35 days."** if you
do a good enough job, I could even get even A's.
\
\
      The little man's face wrinkled like a dishcloth thrown in 
the hamper. He kicked his legs and doubled his fists and he grimaced
and scowled and pursed his lips, **Oh, am I cursed! But I'll do it.**
\
\
      And true to his word, the little elf began to do Patrick's
homework. Exept there was one problem. The elf didn't always know
what to do and he needed help. **"Help me! Help me!"** he'd say.
And Patrick would have to help - in whatever way he can. **"I don't
know this world,"** the elf squeked while reading Patrick's homework.
**"Get me a dictionary. Wait no, even better, look up the word and
sound it out by each letter."**
\
\
      When it came to maths, Patrick was out of luck. **"What are
Time Tables?"** the elf shrieked. **"We elves never need that. And
addition and subtractiob and division and fractions? Here, sit down
beside me, and you simply need to guide me."** Elves know nothing
about human history
